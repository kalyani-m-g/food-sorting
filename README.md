 Favorite Foods Length Sorter
A minimalist HTML + JavaScript app using **Selection Sort** to order a list of favorite foods by name length.

Overview

This is a single-page project (`index.html`) that displays an unsorted list of favorite foods. Click "Sort" to see them arranged from shortest to longest using a plain Selection Sort algorithm.

 What I Learned

- Implemented **Selection Sort** in JavaScript, reinforcing how the algorithm repeatedly finds the shortest item in the remaining array and swaps it forward.
- Manipulated the DOM to display the list **before and after sorting** dynamically.
- Practiced clean project structureâ€”even in simple demos, it's smart to keep HTML, CSS (inline or external), and JS well-organized for readability and maintainability.

 Favorite Feature

Hands down, the one-line comment inside the HTML:

```html
<!-- I sorted my favorite foods by their name length. -->
